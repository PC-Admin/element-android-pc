The Perthchat App is a re-branding of the popular [Element Android](https://github.com/vector-im/element-android) client.

Perthchat.org is a Matrix service run for Perth, Western Australia. Started in 2017 itâ€™s one of the larger Matrix instances in Australia. This service was created to provide a secure, open source and ad-free messaging experience. Matrix servers interconnect allowing users to make friends and join rooms with people from all over the world.
